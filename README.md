# Block Tower Game

## Overview
The Block Tower Game is a 2D game where the goal is to build a tower of blocks on a base without it falling. A block moves upwards, and when the player presses the spacebar, a new block falls and aligns with the current block’s position. If the tower falls or a block is placed outside the green base, the level restarts. The game consists of three levels, with increasing difficulty in terms of block speed and the number of blocks.

## Features
- **Three Levels**: Each level increases the number of blocks and the speed at which the blocks fall.
- **Tower Building**: The goal is to stack the blocks without letting them fall off the base.
- **Game Restart**: If the tower collapses or a block falls outside the base, the level restarts.
- **Progression**: After completing each level, the game automatically progresses to the next level until the final level, where the game ends.

## Controls
- **Spacebar**: Press the spacebar to drop a new block from the current position of the previous block.

## How to Play
1. Start the game by pressing Play in the game window.
2. Blocks will start falling, and your goal is to place them on top of the existing stack.
3. Press the Spacebar to drop the next block.
4. If the stack falls or a block is placed outside the base, the level will restart.
5. After completing all three levels, you’ll reach the end screen, marking the game’s end.
